      "overview": "Civil law covers the everyday situations that affect everyone: when you have a dispute with a supplier, when you buy a house, when you need to manage an inheritance, or when you suffer damage. It's not just about going to court—often it's about finding practical solutions before the situation becomes a lawsuit.\n\nAt the Amaranto Law Firm, we work to protect your rights proactively. Whether you need to draft an important contract, resolve a dispute with a company, recover a sum owed, or manage an inheritance, our goal is to give you clear, understandable solutions that serve your interests. We know that legal issues can seem complicated, which is why we explain everything simply, without unnecessary jargon, helping you understand your options and possible consequences before you decide.",

          "question": "How long does it take to resolve a civil dispute?",
          "answer": "It varies greatly depending on the type of dispute. If we can resolve it amicably (outside court), it might take a few months. If a lawsuit is necessary, it usually takes 2-3 years for the first instance, with the possibility of appeal after. We help you understand realistic timelines from the start."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is it always necessary to go to court?",
          "answer": "No, in fact it's often better to avoid it. There are many ways to resolve disputes: mediation, direct agreements, formal letters. These approaches are often faster, less expensive, and less stressful than going to court. We evaluate with you which option is best."

Whether you've been arrested by police, received a notification of crime, or suspect you're in a difficult legal situation, it's essential to have an experienced lawyer on your side who understands how the criminal justice system works.\n\nAt our firm, criminal defense is not just a legal matter—it's personal. We know that an accused person has rights that must be protected from the very first moment. Whether the situation involves ordinary crimes (theft, assault, fraud) or more specialized matters like military criminal law, our job is to ensure your legal rights are respected, that you're informed about every step of the process, and that your case is defended as effectively as possible.",

          "answer": "First, you have the right to a lawyer and the right to remain silent until your attorney is present. Don't sign anything without consulting your lawyer. Contact us immediately: we'll be at your side at every stage, from police interrogation to trial. The first moment is crucial for protecting your rights."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between an abbreviated trial and a regular trial?",
          "answer": "An abbreviated trial is faster: the judge decides based on documentation without lengthy hearings. The downside is it has fewer evidentiary rules than a regular trial. However, the judge typically applies a sentence reduction (25-30% discount). We'll evaluate together whether it makes sense in your case."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I negotiate a plea agreement to resolve the case quickly?",
          "answer": "Yes, through a plea agreement you can agree on a sentence without trial. It's a quick solution that avoids the trial process and often results in a reduced sentence. It's not allowed in all cases, but we carefully evaluate whether it's right for you."

The decisions you make at this stage—about where your children will live, how much maintenance they'll receive, how you'll divide assets—will have long-term effects on your family.\n\nOur approach is different: we don't want to turn your family conflict into a legal battle if it can be avoided. We seek solutions that protect everyone's interests, especially your children's. Whether you're facing a consensual separation where you both agree, or a more difficult separation where opinions differ, we're here to guide you with both compassion and determination.

          "question": "What's the difference between separation and divorce?",
          "answer": "Separation ends the duties of cohabitation and fidelity, but you remain legally married. It's often the first step when you want to live separately. Divorce completely dissolves the marriage. Typically, after a consensual separation you can file for divorce after 6 months. If the separation is contested, you must wait 3 years."

        {
          "question": "How is custody of my children decided?",
          "answer": "The judge (or you together if you agree) always decides based on what's best for the child. If parents can agree, you can choose joint custody (the child lives with both) or other arrangements. If you can't agree, the judge considers things like each parent's relationship with the child and where the child has been living."

        {
          "question": "How much will I have to pay in child support?",
          "answer": "There's no fixed amount. It depends on how much each parent earns, how many days the child spends with each parent, and the child's expenses. If one parent has no income, they may not need to pay. If you have different incomes, the higher earner contributes more. We always seek fair agreements that allow both parents to support themselves and your child to have everything they need."

There can be disagreements about work that needs to be done, common expenses, noisy neighbors, or management decisions. Condominium law regulates how condominium residents coexist and how these situations are resolved.\n\nMany people don't know they have specific rights in a condominium: for example, you have the right to clear documentation of expenses, to challenge improper assembly decisions, and to defend yourself if someone in the building causes you damage. In our firm, we address these issues in a practical and direct way. Whether you need to defend yourself against questionable expenses, challenge an assembly decision, or a neighbor is creating noise and moisture problems, we're on your side to protect your property owner rights.",

          "question": "Can I challenge decisions made by the condominium assembly?",
          "answer": "Yes, if the resolution is illegitimate or done improperly, you can challenge it in court. However, you have little time: 30 days from when you're notified of the resolution. If you don't file a complaint within this period, you lose the right to challenge it later. We help you understand whether you have concrete grounds to challenge it."

          "question": "Which condominium expenses must I pay?",
          "answer": "Ordinary expenses (management, ordinary maintenance) you must always pay. Extraordinary expenses (major works) depend on how they were decided. If the assembly decided on them improperly, or if the work doesn't comply with regulations, you can contest them. We help you evaluate whether you're right."
        },
        {
          "question": "What can I do if my neighbor makes noise or damages my apartment?",
          "answer": "It depends on the type of damage. If it's just noise, you can first ask the manager to intervene. If the damage causes physical problems (moisture, infiltration, cracks), you can ask the responsible party for compensation. If there's no agreement, we'll take you to court to recover damages."
